                    <h3>I am a designer</h3>
                    <p>I remeber that some 5 years ago I was struck by the beauty of web design. Ever since I wanted to know what makes exceptional web design. Itâ€™s a never-ending quest but during these years I gained an eye for elegant typography, harmonious
                        color combinations and a sense of easy to use, simple interaction. I bring all this to every project I make along with the curiosity and eagerness to learn more and do better still. </p>

                    <h3>I am a developer</h3>
                    <p>My passion for code comes from the fact that I love to bring my designs into (digital) reality. I enjoy coding as a process of splitting a big task into manageable chunks and connecting them into a neat arrangement. I especially like
                        to work with the new tech. ES6 is so much better and more expressive while React makes building complex UIâ€™s an enjoyable process. Check out my wineapp to see React in action with firebase to hold on to data. </p>

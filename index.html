                    <h3>I am a designer</h3>
                    <p>I remeber that some 5 years ago I was struck by the beauty of web design. Ever since I wanted to know what makes exceptional web design. It’s a never-ending quest but during these years I gained an eye for elegant typography, harmonious
                        color combinations and a sense of easy to use, simple interaction. </p>

                    <h3>I am a developer</h3>
                    <p>My passion for code comes from the fact that I love to bring my designs into (digital) reality. I enjoy coding as a process of splitting a big task into manageable chunks and connecting them into a neat arrangement. I especially like
                        to work with the new tech. ES6 is so much better and more expressive while React makes building complex UI’s an enjoyable process. Check out my wineapp to see React in action with firebase to hold on to data. </p>
